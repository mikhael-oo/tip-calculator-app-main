## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Javascript DOM

### What I learned

I learned how to use the DOM in javascript to manipulate the application and make the webapp more interactive and useful. i also was able to use event listeners to manipulate the elements.

### Continued development

I want to dive deeper into using javascript to make websites more interactive and develop more on my use of css.

### Useful resources

- [Javascript and JQuery by Jon Duckett](https://www.javasacriptbook.com) - This helped me with using the DOM and event listeners.
- [HTML and CSS by Jon Duckett](https://www.htmlandcssbook.com) - This was really helpful in styling my app as it helped lay the foundation for flexbox in css.
